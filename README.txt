🎡 Wheel of Fortune Simple HTML/JS/CSS App

An interactive web app that lets users create a spinning wheel of names and randomly select a winner.
🔧 Features
✅ Name Selection

    Users can check/uncheck names from a predefined list.

    Names are remembered using localStorage between sessions.

    A colorful, animated wheel displays all selected names.

🎯 Random Winner

    Spin the wheel to select a random name.

    Winner's name is displayed after the animation completes.

    You can spin by clicking the wheel or the "Spin the Wheel" button.

🔍 Name Search

    Search bar filters the list of names in real time.

    Fully accessible with keyboard and mouse.

🧼 Controls

    Check All: Selects all names.

    Reset All: Clears selections, the wheel, and localStorage.

🧠 How It Works

    Selected names are converted into colored sectors on a conic-gradient wheel.

    On spin, the wheel rotates with a CSS animation.

    The winner is calculated based on the final angle of the wheel.
